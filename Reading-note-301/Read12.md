| **SQL** | **NoSQL** |
|-----|-----|
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases|
| have predefined schema | have dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) |
| not best fit for hierarchical data storage | fits better for the hierarchical data storage |

## sql vs nosql 


**What does SQL stand for?**

- Structured Query Language.

**What is a realational database?**

- It's a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

- works with tables.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

- A cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information 

**What is a NoSQL database?**

- An approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases. 

**Howo does it work?**

- We have databases just like SQL, but it's dynamic, which means it's not a table database but collections that contain documents.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

- We have collections instead of tables, and inside collections we have documents.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

- MongoDB, because it has no specific schema. Also, there are no relations

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

- when you want to update a spcific data, you have to update all collections that contain that data.
