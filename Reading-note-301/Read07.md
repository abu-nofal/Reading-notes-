## How I explained REST to my brother.

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- the one who created the HTTP protocol.


2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
-  Because they weren't designed to be used like that


3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- is all about applying verbs to nouns

- this protocol that allows the computers talking each other and sending data beatween each other.




4. What does a GET do?

- If one system needs to get something from another system

5. What does a POST do?
- If one system needs to add something to another system




6. What does PUT do?
- If a system wants to replace something in another system




7. What does PATCH do?
-to do a partial update
