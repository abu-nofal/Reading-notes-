# Data Modeling

### Review, Research, and Discussion



1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- TDD reduces the time required for project development
- Save project costs in the long run
- Code flexibility and easier maintenance
- With TDD you will get a reliable solution



2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- in the mocking tests, before testing and after testing 

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

- Tests need to be maintained when requirements change.

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

- Classes can’t be called without new, but functions intended as constructors can (and their this will be wrong)
- Classes can extend more types than constructors can (like functions and arrays)
- Classes’ prototypes are their parents (they inherit static properties); writers of constructor functions usually don’t bother with this


5. Why REST?

- REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
- REST Makes your Application More Scalable
- No state
- Faster Data Interchange Format
- Caching is Easier with REST
- REST is Flexibile






### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. functional programming 
- it is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions.

2. object-oriented programming (OOP) 
- it is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

3. class 
- it's a special functions in ES6, it's like a bluebrint for data modeling.

4. super  
- we use this when extending the class, to inherit the previous properties from the parent class.

5. this 
- it is a keyword in javascript that refers to the scope that will be called in.

6. Test Driven Development (TDD) 
- it's a software development practice, by testing then correct the test, then refactor the code.

7. Jest
- it is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests.

8. Continuous Integration (CI)
- it is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

9. REST
- REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

10. Data Model
- Data Model is the modeling of the data description, data semantics, and consistency constraints of the data. It provides the conceptual tools for describing the design of a database at each level of data abstraction. there are four data models used for understanding the structure of the database.
