# How to Solve Programming Problems

- You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

> A simple set of steps

1. Read the problem completely twice.
- This is the single most important step ,You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.

- You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.
- A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6. Optimize the real code.




## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

>  Why is this important?
- Problem solving is the meta-skill.

> So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

 Here are the steps:

1. Understand 

- How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

2. Plan

- Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

- In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. Divide 

- Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

- After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

- Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

4. Stuck? 

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).


5. Practice 

- Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with `<insert concept here>`.” 


## 5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly 

- we look at the 5 Whys technique (sometimes known as 5Y). This is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all.

> How to Use the 5 Whys

 **The model follows a very simple seven-step process:**

1. Assemble a Team

- Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem 

- If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."
- Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. Ask the First "Why?"

- Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")

- Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times 

- For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop

- You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause

6. Address the Root Cause(s) 
- Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring. 

7. Monitor Your Measures

- Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
