# AWS: S3 and Lambda

### Review, Research, and Discussion


1. Describe “The Cloud”
- it is a computer that you used but this computer exists in another place than you.

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

3. What is auto-scaling?
- it is a process in the cloud computing that increase the capacity of the instances dynamicaally when our application need that.

4. What is bandwidth?
- Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
- The three biggest cost centers related to a cloud environment include network, compute, and storage.






### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Server Instances**
- the partition of a computer that you used on the cloud.

**Containers**
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

**Cloud Services**
- the services that you can do on computers online not locally.
or Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.

**Cloud Architecture**
- Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.

**AWS**
- Amazon web Services, it is a platform that provide a cloud computing services in general.

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**
- both of them consider as a Paas, platform as a service.
- we use them to deploy our backend-server in general. but in EB we can deploy even fron-end but in Heroku we can't.
- autoscalling in EB, but manual scalling in Heroku.
