# Component Based UI

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

- Vue.js
- AngularJS
- Ember.js
- Nuxt
- Svelte

2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

- A library is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You don’t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.
- A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. Rendering

- Javascript uses the document object model (DOM) to manipulate the DOM elements. **Rendering** refers to showing the output in the browser.

- The DOM establishes parent-child relationships, and adjacent sibling relationships, among the various elements in the HTML file.

2. Templates

- Javascript Templates are HTML web pages that execute Embedded Javascript on the server before rendering the page back to the client. JST is an extensible environment and allows the direct binding of C functions to Javascript functions, so that a JST web page can easily access device or system data.

3. State

- State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation.
It’s managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).
